# COVID
This project combines data from various sources in attempt to provide accessible routes of analysis of COVID-19 based on location-specific data. 

There are two main sources of high-dimentional data available through this project. The first is the raw data cloned from the [New York Times COVID-19 database](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), including case and death data from each county in the United States. This data is available through a .csv file. The second is a dynamic Pandas dataFrame as a conglomerate of data scraped from three sources.
